<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/tekknolagi). I like to read
books, take photos, and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I [tweet
things](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi) about bread, legumes, and compilers.
Though my official title is Chief Potato, I work at Instagram as a software
engineer. I'm also teaching [CS 50ISDT](/isdt/) this fall at Tufts.

You can [email me](mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com) if you so desire. I'm
happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and more.

## I like making things.

That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* [shru.gg](https://shru.gg), a website built just so I would have to stop
  finding, copying, and pasting that shrug emoticon
* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), Instagram's
  performance-oriented fork of CPython
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison) (fork of
  [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison)), Instagram's
  performance-oriented greenfield implementation of Python
* An [Lisp to x86-64 compiler](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum) I wrote
  in C and accompanying [blog posts](/blog/lisp/)
* The [term paper](/dat-paper/) I wrote for COMP 117 IDS
  analyzing Dat and the Beaker browser
* [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/), a compiler front-end and toolchain for
  OCaml
* The [final project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf)
  and reference implementation (2016) and
  [independent project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-independent.pdf)
  (2016) for the data structures course I TA'ed
* A [distributed ray tracer](https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer) (2015) that I
  made with friends for a concurrent programming course, with the
  [final writeup [PDF]](/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf)

## I kind of maintain a blog.

<del>It's not very interesting just yet.</del> [Things are happening.](/blog/)
